Our game project takes you on a journey through musical history, where you'll join a student on an epic quest after falling asleep.\n\nThe game functions like a typical platformer-game such as Super Mario or Rayman Legends, but with a musical twist. To succeed in each level, players must respond to the rhythm of the music. It's a unique concept that was highly inspired by the “Musical Levels” in Rayman Legends, but we've taken it to a whole new level.\n\nWith each level, you'll encounter new musical genres and iconic artists that shaped the world of music. From the swinging jazz of the 1920s to the electrifying rock of the 80s, you'll experience the beats and melodies that defined each era.\n\nThe graphics are stunning, with each level featuring its own distinct visual style that perfectly complements the music. The controls are intuitive and easy to pick up, but mastering the rhythm takes skill and practice.\n\nWe're confident that our game will provide hours of entertainment for both casual and hardcore gamers alike. So, get ready to put your rhythm skills to the test and join us on this epic musical journey. You can have a taste [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT6XOfy2gEE).\n\n## Technology\n![](notes/images/monogame_logo.webp)\n\nWe want to use [Monogame](https://www.monogame.net/showcase/) as our Game Engine, as it is perfectly suitable for 2d games and has some well known titles like [Terraria](https://terraria.org/) or [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) amongst its users.\nWe want our game to be highly compatible with every mainstream pc operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) and playable by controller.\n\n## Scope\nGet ready to witness the ultimate combination of music and technology! In our lecture project, we aim to create an unforgettable experience by developing 3 handcrafted levels - Classical, Rock'n Roll, and Hip Hop. But that's not all - we'll also be working on an algorithm that can analyze music and generate levels automatically.\n\nWe are passionate about exploring the intersection of music and technology. By handcrafting levels in three distinct genres, we'll showcase the artistry of game design while highlighting the unique characteristics of each music genre. But we won't stop there - we'll also be using cutting-edge algorithms to generate levels automatically, bringing a new level of excitement and challenge to the game.\n\nOur lecture project is the perfect opportunity to delve deeper into the world of music and technology. With each level, you'll discover new sounds and rhythms that will keep you hooked. And with the algorithm in place, the game will constantly evolve, providing a never-ending stream of fresh challenges.\n\nSo, whether you're a music enthusiast or a tech buff, our project has something for everyone. Join us as we explore the limitless possibilities of music and technology, and experience a game like no other.\n\n## Blog Entries\n- [First Blog entry!](notes/First%20Blog%20entry!.md)\n- [Plans No. 1](notes/Plans%20Number%201.md)\n- [Setting up MonoGame for development](notes/Setting%20up%20MonoGame%20for%20development.md)\n- [Creating a Project](notes/Creating%20a%20Project.md)\n- [Getting MGCB Editor to work on Linux](notes/Getting%20MGCB%20Editor%20to%20work%20on%20Linux.md)\n- [First Steps with MonoGame](notes/First%20Steps%20with%20MonoGame.md)\n- [The software you need!](notes/The%20software%20you%20need!.md)\n- [Tuning the Blog](notes/Tuning%20the%20Blog.md)\n- [Review No. 1](notes/Review%20Number%201.md)\n- [Plans No. 2](notes/Plans%20Number%202.md)\n- [Movement and Game Mechanics](notes/Movement%20and%20Game%20Mechanics.md)\n- [Sprite Animations](notes/Sprite%20Animations.md)\n\nFor this project, we have to measure our time per week.

It provides a structure for organizing code, assets, and other resources, and typically includes functionality for handling graphics, input, sound, physics, networking, and other common game development tasks. A game framework allows developers to focus on the game logic and design, without having to worry about low-level details.\n\nExamples of popular game frameworks include:\n\n-   [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)\n-   [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)\n-   [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/)\n\n## Game Engine\n\nA game engine is a more comprehensive set of tools and technologies that provide a complete development environment for building games. In addition to the features found in a game framework, a game engine typically includes a visual editor, scripting tools, and support for creating complex game worlds and scenarios. Game engines are designed to be highly extensible, and often support plugins and third-party tools that allow developers to add custom functionality.\n\nExamples of popular game engines include:\n\n-   [Unity](https://unity.com/)\n-   [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com)\n-   [CryEngine](https://www.cryengine.com/)\n\nIn summary, while both game frameworks and game engines provide a foundation for building games, game engines offer a more complete development environment, with additional tools and features for creating complex games.","lastmodified":"2023-03-19T03:26:04.191341936Z","tags":null},"/notes/Getting-MGCB-Editor-to-work-on-Linux":{"title":"Getting MGCB Editor to work on Linux","content":"To add media to your project, MonoGame uses a proprietary file format to map the media to game entities. \nTo edit the specified file, you need an editor, which runs in your project folder (!!!).\nIn your project folder, you have to run the following commands:\n```zsh\ndotnet mgcb-editor\n```\nIf it doesn't work the first time, don't worry, because you have to run the obvious command of\n```zsh\ndotnet tool restore\n```\n\nIf your output looks like this, you've succeeded!\n![](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020230225171434.webp)\n\nNow you can easily open it with the command \n```zsh\nmgcb-editor\n```\nOr, in Jan's Case\n```zsh\nmgcb-editor-linux\n```\n\n![](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020230225171754.webp)\n\nGreat Success!!!","lastmodified":"2023-03-19T03:26:04.191341936Z","tags":null},"/notes/Impressum":{"title":"Impressum","content":"Angaben gem. § 5 TMG:\n\nJan Neumann\n\nIm Brühl 4\n\n65629 Niederneisen\n\nKontaktaufnahme:\n\nTelefon: + 49 15785853882\n\nE-Mail: [janneumannnneisen@gmail.com](mailto:janneumannnneisen@gmail.com)\n\n**Haftungsausschluss – Disclaimer:**\n\nHaftung für Inhalte\n\nAlle Inhalte unseres Internetauftritts wurden mit größter Sorgfalt und nach bestem Gewissen erstellt.

They are the rules, systems, and interactions that define how a game works and how players engage with it. One of the key aspects of game mechanics is movement, which is essential for navigating the game world and interacting with its various elements. In the game “A Journey of Music”, game mechanics and movement are central to the player's experience. In this game, players embark on a musical adventure, exploring a vibrant and immersive world. This article will delve into the game mechanics and movement of “A Journey of Music”, exploring how they contribute to the game's unique and captivating gameplay.\n\n## Level\nIn “A Journey of Music”, players must keep their focus and timing in check as they navigate a fast-paced musical journey. The level begins with a countdown from 3 to 0, perfectly synced with the beat of the upcoming song. Once the countdown ends, the screen begins to move in time with the music, carrying players along with it as they dodge obstacles and collect points. The speed of the screen movement matches the tempo of the song, making it crucial for players to keep up with the beat to progress successfully. With the pressure on and the music pumping, players must stay alert and skilful to complete this challenging and exciting level.\nOne *optional feature* of enemies that chase players from behind in “A Journey of Music” is their synchronized appearance with the musical time of the level. As players progress through each level, the enemies that pursue them change in appearance, with their design and movement corresponding to the type of the music.\n\n## Death\nIn “A Journey of Music”, death is a crucial mechanic that adds an element of challenge and risk to the gameplay experience. To begin with, the game features level-specific death animations, which means that each level has its unique animation that plays when the player dies. This adds a touch of variety and creativity to the game, making the experience more engaging and immersive.\n\nHowever, death in “A Journey of Music” occurs only when the player moves beyond the boundaries of the screen. This means that players must stay focused and keep up with the rhythm of the music to avoid getting executed by leaving the screen's limits. This further adds to the challenge of the game, as players must not only dodge obstacles and enemies, but also maintain their pace and timing to avoid death.\n\nIf a player does die, they are given the chance to start over, with the game displaying the percentage of their lost run. This feature adds an element of motivation for players, encouraging them to keep trying and improving their performance with each run. Overall, the death mechanic in “A Journey of Music” creates an engaging and challenging gameplay experience, encouraging players to keep pushing their limits and perfect their skills.\n\n## Obstacles and Controls\n\n### Running\n\n![](notes/images/Running.webp)\n\nThe running mechanic in \"A Journey of Music\" is a fundamental aspect of the gameplay experience. To move the character to the right, players can either press the \"D\" key on their keyboard or the right arrow button. Alternatively, players can move the left thumb stick on their controller to the right, allowing for a more intuitive and responsive control scheme.\n\n### Jumping\n\n![](notes/images/SingleJump.webp)\n\nThe jumping mechanic in \"A Journey of Music\" allows players to navigate obstacles and enemies by leaping over them. To jump, players can either press the \"Space\" key on their keyboard or the \"A\" or \"X\" button on their controller, depending on their platform of choice. This mechanic requires careful timing and precision to master, adding an element of challenge and excitement to the gameplay experience.\n\n### Double Jump\n\n![](notes/images/DoubleJump.webp)\n\nDouble jumping is a powerful technique in \"A Journey of Music\" that allows players to reach higher platforms and avoid obstacles with ease. To perform a double jump, players need to first execute a regular jump by pressing the \"Space\" key on their keyboard or the \"A\" or \"X\" button on their controller. Just before the initial jump ends, the player can press the same button again to execute a second jump, propelling them even higher.\n\nTiming is crucial when performing a double jump, as pressing the button too early or too late can result in the player falling short or overshooting their target. With practice, however, players can use double jumping to navigate through levels quickly and efficiently, unlocking new paths and secrets along the way.\n\n### Sliding\n\n![](notes/images/Sliding.webp)\n\nSliding is a key mechanic in \"A Journey of Music\" that allows players to dodge obstacles and enemies by quickly sliding under them. To slide, players can press the \"Shift\" key on their keyboard or the \"Y\" and \"B\" buttons on their controller, depending on their platform of choice. This mechanic requires fast reflexes and careful timing, adding an exciting element of skill-based gameplay to the experience.\n\n### Jump + Hold\n\n![](notes/images/JumpHold.webp)\nThe \"Jump+Hold\" mechanic allows players to slide down ropes and descend to lower areas by holding onto them. To perform a Jump+Hold, players need to execute a regular jump by pressing the \"Space\" key on their keyboard or the \"A\" or \"X\" button on their controller. As the player approaches the rope, they need to press and hold the same button to grab onto it.\n\nOnce the player has grabbed onto the rope, they can continue holding the button to slide down the rope. Releasing the button will cause the player to let go of the rope and drop to the ground. This mechanic can be used to descend to lower platforms or avoid obstacles in the player's path.\n\nThe Jump+Hold mechanic requires careful timing and coordination, making it a fun and challenging addition to the game's mechanics. With practice, players can use this technique to navigate through levels quickly and efficiently, unlocking new paths and secrets along the way.\n\n## Menu\nThe menu structure in “A Journey of Music” is designed to be simple and intuitive, with a focus on providing players with quick access to the core gameplay experience. From the main menu, players are presented with two primary options: Play Game and Settings.\n\nIf the player chooses to play the game, they will be presented with a selection of levels to choose from. This selection could be presented as a list or as an interactive map, depending on the game's design. Each level may be unlocked sequentially or become accessible all at once, depending on the game's progression mechanics.\n\nOnce the player has selected a level, they will be taken to a loading screen that displays the name of the level and some relevant information, such as the musical genre or tempo. From here, the player can start the level and begin their musical journey.\n\nAlternatively, if the player selects Settings from the main menu, they will be taken to a submenu that offers a range of customizable options, such as graphics settings, audio settings, and control options. This allows the player to tailor the game's experience to their device specifications and personal preferences.\n\nOverall, the menu structure in “A Journey of Music” is designed to be streamlined and straightforward, allowing players to dive right into the gameplay or customize their experience quickly and easily.\n\n## Settings\nThe Settings menu in “A Journey of Music” offers players a range of options to customize their gameplay experience. One of the key features of the Settings menu is the ability to enable dynamic resolution, which adjusts the game's resolution to fit different screen sizes. This means that players with smaller screens can still enjoy a high-quality visual experience without compromising on performance, while those with larger screens can scale up the game's graphics for a more immersive experience.\n\nIn addition to dynamic resolution, the Settings menu also includes volume sliders for in-game sounds and music. This allows players to fine-tune the audio experience to their personal preferences, adjusting the volume of sound effects and music independently. For players who want to fully immerse themselves in the game's soundtrack, the music volume slider can be cranked up to maximum, while those who prefer a more subdued audio experience can adjust the settings accordingly.\n\nOverall, the Settings menu in “A Journey of Music” offers players a range of customizable options to optimize their gameplay experience, allowing them to tailor the game's visuals and audio to their preferences and device specifications.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-19T03:26:04.191341936Z","tags":null},"/notes/Plans-Number-1":{"title":"Plans No. 1","content":"As it is only the start of the semester, we have more time than in three months from now, so we can put a lot of time into this.\nThat's why we came up with some objectives for the weekend and next week:\n\n## To-do's\n- Logo's and Design for the game and this blog\n- First steps in [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/)\n- Final Decision on whether we use MonoGame or [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)\n- Further Concept improvements that will be announced on the [main site](blog.newmanity.eu)\n- (maybe) [A first approach at platform mechanics and platform levels](notes/Movement%20and%20Game%20Mechanics.md)\n\nSee our [review](notes/Review%20Number%201.md) of this week's plans","lastmodified":"2023-03-19T03:26:04.191341936Z","tags":null},"/notes/Plans-Number-2":{"title":"Plans No. 2","content":"As we concluded [last week's](notes/Plans%20Number%201.md) plans in our [weekly review](notes/Review%20Number%201.md), we already thought of plans for this the week from 06.03 to 11.03.\n\n## To-do's\n- Further refactoring of the game's code\n- Implementation of physics and platform mechanics\n- [Improve Concept (originally planned last week)](notes/Movement%20and%20Game%20Mechanics.md)\n- Controller support\n- [Sprite Animations](notes/Sprite%20Animations.md)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-19T03:26:04.191341936Z","tags":null},"/notes/Review-Number-1":{"title":"Review No. 1","content":"As we described our goals for the [last week](notes/Plans%20Number%201.md) last weekend, we wanted to review our ongoings and also updating you on our [plans for next week](notes/Plans%20Number%202.md)!\n\n## Designing a logo and design for the game and blog\n\n![](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020230304171946.webp)\n\nThis is our freshly designed logo for the game and blog.

At the moment, we are running into compatibility issues on Linux, but we are looking forward to sorting those out by next week.\n\n![](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020230228184631.webp)\nFor our level-design, we aim to use `Tilemaps` as a construct for our levels. To design those, we want to use the [Tiled-Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/), as it is available for all main platforms and widely used as well.","lastmodified":"2023-03-19T03:26:04.191341936Z","tags":null},"/notes/Times":{"title":"Times","content":"\n| Week             | Jan (in hours) | Marvin (in hours) |\n| ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |\n| 1.
