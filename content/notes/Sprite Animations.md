After a pause from blogging, we can announce, that we managed to have run our first sprite animations.
As [MonoGame](https://monogame.net) is only a [game framework](notes/Game%20Frameworks.md) and not a complete game engine, it means for us, that we had to do much from the ground up, on ourselves.

## What did we do?

Besides other university projects (there's much to do) we had some time to further work on our game and with some tutorials from YouTube, with the one of [GameDev Quickie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm4PkqS2bqY&list=PLkEsuRhhI3ne0BcsCmwAZG-shlHyDfvKc&index=15) being the most helpful one and we managed to implement the code and execute it succesfully.
Now with the spritesheet animation classes established, we can work on physics and levels.

## Showcase?
