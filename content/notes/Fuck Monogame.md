We've made mistakes, we finally admit it!
Whilst [Monogame](https://www.monogame.net/showcase/) was our original choice, the hiccups and discontinued libraries made it nearly impossible to got something going. Those 3 weeks we needed for importing `.tmx`-files were unnecessary and costed us a lot of time. 
That's why we underwent an engine switch to [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/).
This transition has multiple advantages over Monogame whilst adding to our original principles for our game-engine choosing.
Godot is also
- open-source
- cross-os-compatible
- huge variety of input devices

but has and is, in comparison to Monogame
- a huge community
- most functions are built-in
- huge, high quality tutorials
- fantastic documentation
- leading edge.

## Transitioning Process

Because, we haven't got that far, there was not a lot of progress lost. 
We easily could reuse our [custom made assets](notes/Graphical%20Process.md) and could directly feel the intuitiveness of Godot, by easily creating and rendering a tile map.
The controls, animations, and physics of the player and the world were also quickly implemented and by the end of Saturday, the 22. Of April, we overtook our previous progress with an increased development speed.
