The term is almost over and we wanted to say thank you to our readers!
It has been a fun project and we definitely learned a thing or two ;).

While our testing phase of the semester has already started, we will continue to run this blog and contribute to the knowledge accumulated on here. 

Thank you

Jan Neumann (@iNewmanity)

## What we will do (in our freetime!)
-   add a second level, with the promised rhythm based jumping
-   opt for a game analytics service that actually works
-   improve game & code structure
	-   cleanup
-   setting up ci/cd for automatic releases
-   most important: add documentationÂ 
	-   when we learned one thing, its that documentation is key
-   extend our blog
