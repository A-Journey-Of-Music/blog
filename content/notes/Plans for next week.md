As it is only the start of the semester, we have more time than in three months from now so we can put a lot of time into this.
That's why we came up with some objectives for the weekend and next week:

## Todo's
- Logo's and Design for the game and this blog
- First steps in [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/)
- Final Decision on wether we use MonoGame or [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
- Further Concept improvements that will be announced on the [main site](blog.newmanity.eu)
- (maybe) A first approach at platform mechanics and platform levels
