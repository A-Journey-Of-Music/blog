To get users to continue playing your game isn't easy. That's, why there are so-called addictive patterns.

## Addictive Patterns
Addictive patterns in computer games can be important because they keep players engaged and coming back for more. Many game developers intentionally design their games to create addictive experiences, using techniques like reward schedules and variable reinforcement to encourage players to keep playing. While addiction to computer games can have negative consequences for some individuals, the majority of players are able to enjoy games in moderation without any significant problems. Furthermore, the development of games that provide healthy, rewarding experiences for players can be a valuable tool in promoting positive mental health and well-being. Ultimately, it is up to game developers and players alike to be mindful of the potential risks and benefits of addictive patterns in computer games.
