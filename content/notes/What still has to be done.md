At last, we want to provide a list, with features, which we haven't finished or even started yet, but would definitely add to the look an feel of our game.

## Game overall
- More detailled worlds, especially on the tilemap side
- Double Jumps and Slides, Jump and Hold -> [Movement and Game Mechanics](notes/Movement%20and%20Game%20Mechanics.md)
- Algorithm for automated map making
	- automated map generation in godot
	- algorithm for analysing rythm and melodic patterns in music
- Documentation -> We still want to do that for our follow ups
- Character Selection

## Technical Side
- Real analytics, GameAnalytics.com is an option, but its a hassle to work with / seems not legit
	- Left only implemented in savegames
- Settings-Menu
- More Best Practices in Godot -> Will be done by us, when we have some freetime
- Dynamic Resolutions
- More Clean Code Practices

## Applications welcome!
