Hey there,
For our games lecture at DHBW Karlsruhe we have to run a blog, where we tell you about our findings and development of our game "A Journey of Music".

Firstly Marvin and I want to thank [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for their template for this Blog. 
We want to use the Occasion to explain how we run it. 

More Information you will find [here](notes/Blog%20Setup.md)!
