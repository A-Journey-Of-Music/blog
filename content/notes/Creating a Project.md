To create a Monogame project, you have to navigate into your project folder and fill this template with the correct arguments:
```zsh
dotnet new <TemplateID> -o <ProjectName>
```
For Jan, the solution on Fedora being:
```zsh
dotnet new mgdesktopgl -o AJourneyOfMusic
```

To read, how Jan got the MGCB Editor to run on Linux, read [here](notes/Getting%20MGCB%20Editor%20to%20work%20on%20Linux.md).
