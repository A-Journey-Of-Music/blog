Greetings! It's been a while since our last update, but we've been hard at work on our game development project. While we're not quite ready to share a playable prototype just yet, we wanted to take this opportunity to share some of the challenges we've encountered and outline our remaining tasks.

Unfortunately, we've run into some issues with MonoGame's libraries - many of them are now deprecated and no longer compatible with the latest versions of the [game framework](notes/Game%20Frameworks.md). This means that we've had to take on the task of implementing many features ourselves, leading to a steep learning curve. On the plus side, we'll come out of this project as MonoGame experts!

Moving forward, here's what's on our roadmap:

-   Importing and using tilemaps created with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
-   Implementing physics
-   Building an enemy system
-   Scaling for more levels
-   Improving our texturing and scaling workflows, including finding the ideal resolution and implementing runtime scaling
-   Establishing CI/CD for building an executable
-   Providing instructions for the music students involved in the project.

Thanks for sticking with us - we're excited to share our progress with you soon.
