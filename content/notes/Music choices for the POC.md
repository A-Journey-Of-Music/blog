Exciting news! We've made a decision on the soundtrack for our Proof of Concept. In keeping with our plan to create three levels set in different musical eras, we've carefully selected the following songs:

1. Mozart-Level: Die Zauberflöte, K.620, Act 2: "Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen"
	- We decided on this song, because, other than other classical music, it has a steady beat.
	- [Spotify-Link](https://open.spotify.com/track/2fMcjr9XcfqeWsHDrC1try?si=44e58057ae8f4bca)
	- [YouTube-Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuBeBjqKSGQ)
2. Rock-Level: "I was made for lovin' you" ~ Kiss
	- This song was chosen, because the Kiss-Characters can be visualized in a very cool way.
	- [Spotify-Link](https://open.spotify.com/track/761U61Joa2pOsb5aRd5elL?si=5a758cde045542ef)
	- [YouTube-Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhIsAZO5gl0)
3. Hip/Hop/Gangster-Rap-Level: "Showtime Fourever" ~ Kollegah
	- This song was chosen, because of the cool atmosphere, which can be represented according to associated level
	- [Spotify-Link](https://open.spotify.com/track/348bH3kD6zRt48AbiNQuUx?si=628fd94f940844ac)

These songs perfectly capture the mood and atmosphere of each era and will help to immerse players in the game world. We can't wait for you to hear them!
