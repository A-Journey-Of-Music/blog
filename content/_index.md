#  A Journey of Music
Hey there,
this is our blog accompanying the development of our games lecture project.

## What is the Game about?
Our Game is about a student who falls asleep and finds himself on a journey through musical history. 
The Game functions like a typical platformer-game (Super Mario, Rayman Legends), but with rythm. If the player responds to the rythm he will suceed in the level. This idea is highly inspired by the "Musical Levels" from Rayman Legends. You can have a taste [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT6XOfy2gEE).

## Technology
![](notes/images/monogame_logo.webp)

We want to use [Monogame](https://www.monogame.net/showcase/) as our Game Engine, as it is perfectly suitable for 2d games and has some well known titles like [Terraria](https://terraria.org/) or [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) amongst its users.
We want our game to be highly compatible with every mainstream pc operating system (Windows, MacOs, Linux) and playable by controller.

## Scope
For the Scope of the lecture, we want create 3 Levels (Classical, Rock'n Roll and HipHop) by hand and work on an algorithm, which can analyze music and create levels automatically.
